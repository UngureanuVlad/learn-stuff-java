# Multi-Project Java Maven Repository

This repository contains multiple **independent Java projects**, each managed using **Apache Maven**. Every project is located in its own directory with its own `pom.xml` and `main` class.

Each project is **self-contained** and can be opened, built, and run separately using any Java IDE.

## How to Build and Run a Project

Each subdirectory in this repository represents a standalone Maven project. To build and run any project:

1. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE, such as:
    - IntelliJ IDEA
    - Eclipse
    - Visual Studio Code (with Java extensions)

2. Build the project using the following Maven command:
   mvn clean install

3. Run the main class:
    - Locate the class containing the `public static void main(String[] args)` method
    - Run it from your IDE
    - Or use the following Maven command:
      mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="io.learnstuff.Main"

   Replace `io.learnstuff.Main` with the fully qualified name of your actual main class

## Notes

- These projects are not connected and do not use a shared parent pom.xml
- There is no multi-module setup â€” each is intended to run individually
